# oop-exam

My exam of object-oriented programming. 

These exercises (and much more) can be found at [java-core](https://github.com/nbicocchi/java-core.git) or [oop-java](https://github.com/SaverioNapolitano/oop-java.git) repos.

As a theoretical question, I was asked the main difference between Python dictionaries and Java HashMaps (dict preserve the insertion order).
